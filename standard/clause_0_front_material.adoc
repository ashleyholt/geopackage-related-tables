[big]*i.     Abstract*

A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.

This document defines an extension that allows a GeoPackage to contain additional data that is related to one or more features or attributes.
As an example, this can be used to establish a many-to-many relationship between features (e.g. points, lines, or areas) and multimedia files. 
To support this, an ancillary data table (`gpkgext_relations`) is used.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The GeoPackage Related Tables extension defines the rules and requirements for associating tables with existing feature or attribute tables in a GeoPackage <<GPKG1_2>> data store. One use case for this extension is to associate features with related multimedia content such as:

* photographs;
* audio or video files; or,
* PDFs.

For example, implementing this extension would provide the ability to associated pictures of a house with a specific parcel.

This extension, like all GeoPackage extensions, is intended to be transparent and to not interfere with GPKG compliant, but non-supporting, software packages. The OGC GeoPackage (GPKG) Related Tables Extension Interoperability Experiment (GPKG-RTE IE) <<GPKG-RTE_IE>> verified that the extension is correctly designed to meet the design goals and to be transparent in this manner. The goal of the IE was achieved by building GeoPackages containing embedded multimedia content and sharing those GeoPackages with other software products. This IE produced an OGC Engineering Report <<GPKG-RTE_IE_ER>> that discusses whether the extension is fit for use and adoption by the OGC.

The following information is provided in compliance with the GeoPackage Extension template as defined in Annex E: GeoPackage Extension Template of the GeoPackage Standard. These additional introductory clauses are not elements in the standard OGC document template.

* Extension Author: GeoPackage SWG; author_name `gpkg` to be used upon adoption.
* Extension Name or Template: `related_tables`; upon adoption the alias `gpkg_related_tables` MAY be used
* Extension Type: This extension provides new requirements dependent on GeoPackage http://www.geopackage.org/spec120/index.html#features[Clause 2.1] and http://www.geopackage.org/spec120/index.html#attributes[Clause 2.4].
* Applicability: This extension defines a relationship between feature tables and aspatial tables that hold related content (e.g., media).
* Scope: read-write
