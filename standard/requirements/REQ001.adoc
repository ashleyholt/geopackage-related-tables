A GeoPackage that contains a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table for `gpkgext_relations` SHALL contain at least one related table relationship.

[NOTE]
====
The intent of this requirement is that a GeoPackage shall not declare the Related Tables Extension unless it is used within the GeoPackage. However because a user defined mapping table may be empty, there may not yet be any related data in the GeoPackage.
