A mapping table MAY contain no rows. Each row that is present SHALL map a row of the base table to a row of the attribute table. The `base_id` column SHALL correlate to the primary key of the base table (as identified by the `base_primary_column` of the associated row in `gpkgext_relations`). The `attribute_id` column SHALL correlate to the primary key of the attribute table (as identified by the `attribute_primary_column` of the associated row in `gpkg_extensions`).
