|*Requirement 2* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/table-defs/extensions-gerr +
 +

A GeoPackage that contains a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table for `gpkgext_relations` SHALL contain at least one related table relationship.
 {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|===

[NOTE]
====
The intent of this requirement is that a GeoPackage shall not declare the Related Tables Extension unless it is used within the GeoPackage. However because a user defined mapping table may be empty, there may not yet be any related data in the GeoPackage. As a consequence, if all related table relationships are removed, the extension must be removed from `gpkg_extensions` as well.
